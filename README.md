All of these commands are built-in to windows
by default. This tool arranges the networking
batch commands into an easily accessible environment.
It allows you to save the results to a file that will be 
stored in the **SavedResults** folder, which is created on the first run.
**cmd.exe** does support saving results to files as well.         

# Help
## Notes
- DO NOT run the program as administrator. It won't be able to access the **Resources** folder if you do so.
- If you see some weird messages after typing in a number for a feature, it is completely normal. Just type in the number for what you'd like to do.
- It is recommended to switch on show file extensions.
- DO NOT RENAME ANY OF THE FILES OR IT WILL NOT WORK.
- When you save results to a file, the program creates a random id for it.
  
## Errors

If it cannot find the **SavedResults** folder,
then double click on **Networking tool.cmd** and it should work.
